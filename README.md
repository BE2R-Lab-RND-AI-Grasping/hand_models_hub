The closed-chain kinematics is the primary hand model ("DP-Flex_closed_kinematics.xml"), utilizing an underactuated five-bar spring-loaded mechanism.

The open-chain kinematics model ("DP-Flex_opened_kinematics.xml") is provided to enable control without underactuation.   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/388905f2-74cc-44e9-936a-550df6bad1c4)


The open-chain kinematics model ("DP-Flex_opened_kinematics_primitive.xml"), which replaces meshes with primitives, allows for faster hand simulation.

For comparison, a model containing both primitives and meshes ("DP-Flex_opened_kinematics_primitive_and_mesh.xml") is also provided.   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1374c06-0b0e-4f89-b4a5-7d447af38d54)
